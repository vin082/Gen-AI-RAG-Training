      "Recent improvements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems include several key advancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sufficient Context**: A recent study presented at ICLR 2025 introduced the concept of \"sufficient context\" in RAG systems. This research focuses on determining when a language model has enough information to provide a correct answer. By quantifying context sufficiency, the study aims to reduce hallucinations by ensuring that the model has adequate context before generating responses. Recommendations from this research include adding a sufficiency check before generation, retrieving more context, re-ranking retrieved contexts, and tuning an abstention threshold based on confidence and context signals.

      "\n",
      "2. **RAG as a Foundational Capability**: Predictions for 2026 suggest that RAG will transition from an experimental innovation to a foundational capability in AI systems. RAG platforms are expected to evolve into full-featured environments with modular capabilities, enhancing productivity by integrating verified organizational data into generative responses. This shift will blur the lines between traditional SaaS and emerging AI-as-a-Service models, making RAG an essential layer for business operations.

      "\n",
      "3. **RAG-R for National Security**: A development known as RAG-R focuses on using RAG systems for national security by integrating real-time access to authoritative, mission-specific data. This approach allows generative models to focus on reasoning and operational decision-making, addressing core limitations in national security environments. [Read more](https://www.executivebiz.com/articles/saic-jay-meil-rag-r-llm-national-security)\n",

    "## Key Takeaways and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tool Design (Updated for v1)\n",
    "- **Use @tool decorator**: Cleaner and more maintainable\n",
    "- **Clear docstrings**: Help agent understand when to use each tool\n",
    "- **Type hints**: Required for proper tool argument parsing\n",
    "- **Good naming**: Use descriptive, intuitive function names\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prompt Engineering\n",
    "- **Use system_prompt**: Simple string instead of complex templates\n",
    "- **Tool guidelines**: Provide clear criteria for tool selection\n",
    "- **Be explicit**: Tell agent how to reason and respond\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Message Handling (NEW)\n",
    "- **Message format**: Use `{\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"...\")]}` \n",
    "- **Access results**: Final answer in `result['messages'][-1].content`\n",
    "- **Conversation threads**: Use thread_id for multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Performance Optimization\n",
    "- **Chunk size**: Balance between context and precision\n",
    "- **Number of retrievals**: More isn't always better (k=3 is often good)\n",
    "- **Caching**: Cache embeddings and frequent queries\n",
    "- **Streaming**: Use `.stream()` for better user experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. LangGraph Features (Built-in with v1)\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Add `checkpointer` for conversation memory\n",
    "- **Streaming**: Multiple modes (\"values\", \"updates\", \"messages\")\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-loop**: Pause for approval before actions\n",
    "- **Time travel**: Rewind and explore alternate paths\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Production Considerations\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Built-in retry and error handling\n",
    "- **Rate limiting**: Prevent API abuse\n",
    "- **Logging**: Use LangSmith for tracing and debugging\n",
    "- **Security**: Sanitize tool inputs and outputs\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Track costs, latency, and success rates\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic RAG with LangChain v1 represents a powerful evolution in building intelligent applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Simpler API**: `create_agent()` replaces complex multi-step setup\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Agent intelligently chooses the right tool for each query\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Multi-Source Information**: Combines vector DB, web search, APIs, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Built on LangGraph**: Automatic persistence, streaming, and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Better Developer Experience**: Less boilerplate, clearer patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Production-Ready**: Built-in error handling, retries, and monitoring support\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Experiment with different tool combinations for your use case\n",
    "2. Add custom tools using the `@tool` decorator\n",
    "3. Implement conversation persistence with checkpointers\n",
    "4. Use LangSmith for tracing and evaluation\n",
    "5. Deploy with proper monitoring and rate limiting\n",
